permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the identity of each animal. Face recognition technique is a personal identification system that uses personal characteristics to identify the Face. Face recognition procedure consists of two phases, namely face detection, where this process takes place very rapidly, except under conditions where the object is located at a short distance away, then the introduction, which recognize a face as individuals. Stage is then developed as a model for facial face recognition system which is one of the much-studied biometrics technology and developed by experts. Checking of wild animal in their prevalent environment is crucial This project proposes to develops an algorithm for detecting animals in the wild. This project creates an algorithm to identify animals in the outdoors. Given the diversity of creatures, manually identifying them can be a difficult undertaking. This algorithm classifies an animal based on their images so we can identify them more efficiently. Animal detection and classification may aid in prevention of animal accidents, tracking animals and can prevent theft. This task can be achieved by applying effective deep learning algorithms.'
