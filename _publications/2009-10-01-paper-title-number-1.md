excerpt: 'Nowadays, the use of renewable energy to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming has become an increasing trend. Several countries present a high potential in Photovoltaics, which allows these two energy sources to be studied with considerable impact. However, due to the challenge of climate and energy crisis, renewable energy generation are intermittent and variable, as the energy sources at the ground level is highly dependent on cloud cover variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and other atmosphere parameters such as the air temperature, humidity, insulation and so on. This inherent variability of large-scale energy generation poses substantial challenges to smart grid energy management. Consequently, there is a need to mitigate those errors. Thus, accurate predictions of the amount of renewable energy that can be produced in future is an important task. Renewable energy prediction represents an important and active job in the renewable energy sector. In order to improve the prediction ability of renewable energy, Machine Learning Algorithms play an important role in this field. In this Proposed work, renewable energy sources are forecast by utilizing various data mining techniques, Numerical Weather Data (NWD), including pre-processing historical load data and the load time series’ characteristics. After forecasting, with the objectives of minimizing overall cost and minimizing power loss, the optimal model is built.'
