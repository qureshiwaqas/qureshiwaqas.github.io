Final year undergraduate student at M.H. Saboo Siddik College of Engineering (Mumbai University). Have a prominent interest in data science and machine learning and hoping to contribute in the field. I interned at a biotech start-up backed by the government of India and many other international firms, as an ML intern, wherein my daily tasks included reading papers, developing machine learning models, finding novel ways to process the ECG signal to find out insights about the requirements of the project. Apart from being one of the top-performers in class Iâ€™m also an active leader for organizing extra-curricular activities within the campus. Having published multiple papers in the field, I am looking forward to pursue my masters and do more rigorous research under the guidance of erudite professors.
